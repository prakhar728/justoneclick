Yeah this website was more of a personal project to build a site to showcase some pictures clicked by my friend.

## LIBRARY

All the Animations and Scroll Triggers were made using the [GSAP-GreenSock](https://greensock.com/gsap/)

<p>The site needs a lot of work and I'll keep updating it.</p>

It's also live [here](https://justoneclick.netlify.app/).

## The major things that I need to work on are
1. Make styling for CSS and Update Js according
2. Optimize size and scaling of images.
3. Add a full Gallery 
4. Add a contact form

## Steps to run it on your local machine

1. Download the ZIP file or pull the repository in your local machine.
2. Open the index.html.
